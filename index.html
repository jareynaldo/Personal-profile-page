        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a highschool student who loves to learn and explore. I'm origannly 
          from cuba but moved stateside in 2013. My whole life i've been intrested in learning
          new skill and always going on new adventures, and my software development is just
          the newest of my adventures.
        </p>
        <p>I've lived in so many differnt places and with so many diffenrt people that i feel
          at home almost anywhere. It's allowed me to be incredely divercified, not only with my 
          but also with the people i've been able to interact with and understand. I absoluteley 
          love learning about new things and people.
